To specify threads per group:

Create custom thread pool (might be able to extend their SimpleThreadPool) where instead of having global number of 
threads, we have number per job group. There is then a way to override the threadpool implementation quartz uses:

Add these instructions to Wiki:

To setup from scratch

1. Install tomcat.
2. Copy citrine.properties.example to citrine.properties and set DB, e-mail etc as necessary
3. ant generate-ddl
4. run build/tasks.ddl against the database
5. update citrine.properties to reflect the database you have just created
6. copy citrine.properties to somewhere on TOMCAT_HOME classpath (TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ in 6.0.24)
7. ant deploy (deploys to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps, override this by setting deploy.dir property in build.properties)
8. If stack trace complaining about "hibernate dialect must be explicitly set", look higher up in trace, probably a db auth issue
9. Go to http://localhost:8080/citrine/ in a browser.
