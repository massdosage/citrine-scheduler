To deploy war file to Maven Central (if you have rights):

1. Set the version number and date in the changelog.txt.
2. mvn release:prepare (this currently fails due to some passphrase issue when trying to commit on Google Code svn, not sure how to get this working).
3. mvn release:perform

To build and deploy the .gz files to Google Code:

1. Follow the steps above.
2. Run mvn package
3. Manually upload target/citrine-4.2.1-bin.tar.gz and target/citrine-4.2.1-src.tar.gz (I tried various mvn plugins but none worked).
