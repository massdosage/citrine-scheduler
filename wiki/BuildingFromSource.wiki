#summary How to build Citrine from source.

= Introduction =

This page describes the steps needed to get Citrine set up for development and covers checking out the code and building it from source. 


= Details =

==Checkout the latest code from SVN==
If you want to modify the source code based on the current trunk version you should follow the instructions on the [http://code.google.com/p/citrine-scheduler/source/checkout source] page. If you do not have SVN commit rights you can still check out the code and create and submit a patch with your changes.

==Building from source==
By default the Citrine build will retrieve all required 3rd party libraries from [http://code.google.com/p/ivyroundup/ Ivy Roundup]. Certain libraries cannot be automatically downloaded so they must be downloaded manually. Follow the instructions [http://code.google.com/p/ivyroundup/wiki/ManuallyDownloadedSoftware here] to download *javamail* and *jta*. 

==Customising the build==
Various aspects of the build can be configured. To do this copy the file in the project root folder
{{{
build.properties.example
}}}
to 
{{{
build.properties
}}}
This file is commented and explains the various properties that are commonly changed.

# Copy `ivysettings.xml.example` to `ivysettings.xml` and modify it to suit your setup.  # Copy `build.properties.example` to `build.properties` and set the values according to your setup.
# Run 
{{{
ant -Dskip.retrieve=true -Dversion=0 install
}}} 
*(TODO - does above still work? and why do we need version? and skipping retrieve? and maybe build would be better to describe, install can be described separately)*
which will compile the Java source code, build `ivysvnresolver.jar` into `build/dist` and then copy this, `ivysettings.xml`, `ivy-common-targets.xml` and the required 3rd party libraries to your `ANT_HOME/lib` folder.
