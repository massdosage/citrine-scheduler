#summary How to install Citrine

= Installing Citrine =

*TODO: Steps installing from .war - tomcat, database etc*

== Prerequisites ==
 # Tomcat 6.x installed to $TOMCAT_HOME.
 # MySql 5.x installed.

== Setting up the Citrine database ==

3. ant generate-ddl
4. run build/tasks.ddl against the database

== Setting up Citrine ==

2. Copy citrine.properties.example to citrine.properties and set DB, e-mail etc as necessary
5. update citrine.properties to reflect the database you have just created
6. copy citrine.properties to somewhere on TOMCAT_HOME classpath (TOMCAT_HOME/lib/ in 6.0.24)

7. ant deploy (deploys to /usr/local/tomcat/webapps, override this by setting deploy.dir property in build.properties)
8. If stack trace complaining about "hibernate dialect must be explicitly set", look higher up in trace, probably a db auth issue
9. Go to http://localhost:8080/citrine/ in a browser.
